# 11 · Milestones and build order

Build in this order. Each phase has exit criteria that gate the next. Durations are estimates for a team of 2 Solidity, 2
TypeScript/full-stack and 1 risk/quant person.

| Phase | Focus | Est. | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Validation | 3 weeks | All [VERIFY] items in [12](12-open-questions.md) answered; 15 borrower interviews; go/no-go memo |
| 1 | Lending core contracts | 6 weeks | [03](03-lending-markets.md), [04](04-oracle.md), [05](05-collateral-router.md) acceptance criteria pass on fork |
| 2 | App, indexer, API, testnet | 6 weeks | [06](06-web-app.md), [07](07-short-interest.md) acceptance; 2 testnet weekends clean; 20 external testers |
| 3 | Audit, guarded mainnet | 6–8 weeks | 2 audits closed; runbooks drilled; mainnet with caps in [10](10-risk-compliance.md); fees live ([09 §1](09-backstop-fees.md)) |
| 4 | Delta-neutral vault | 8 weeks after sim gate | [08](08-delta-neutral-vault.md) sim gate, audit, 30-day run |
| 5 | Backstop, then token later | TBD | [09 §2](09-backstop-fees.md) acceptance; token only with revenue + legal |

## Phase 1 task breakdown (lending core)

Ordered so each task unblocks the next. IDs map to requirements.

1. **Repo scaffold.** Monorepo per [02](02-architecture.md); Foundry with Morpho Blue + MetaMorpho submodules; CI (forge test, fmt, slither); `packages/sdk` with addresses and ABIs.
2. **Mocks.** Mock Stock Token with ERC-8056 multiplier, mock Chainlink feed with `updatedAt` control, mock USDG, mock DEX/aggregator.
3. **`StockWrapper`.** LM-R1…R7, invariant tests.
4. **`MarketHours`.** OR-R10…R12, plus the calendar generator script (`script/genSessions.ts`).
5. **`StocklineOracle`.** OR-R1…R5, OR-R20…R23, OR-R30…R32. SDK mirror `bufferAt`, `priceAt`, and a cross-check test.
6. **`clUSDG`.** CL-R1…R6.
7. **Deploy scripts.** Market + MetaMorpho vault + idle market per stock (LM-R10, LM-R20…R22).
8. **`StocklineRouter`.** RT-R1…R7, all flows, fork tests.
9. **Allocator keeper.** LM-R30…R34.
10. **Guard keeper.** OR-R31, including `poke()`.
11. **Fallback liquidator bot.** Uses the Morpho callback; unwraps `clUSDG`.
12. **Full lifecycle fork test.** Lend → open short → weekend ramp → Monday gap → liquidation → lender withdraws whole.

## Phase 2 task breakdown

1. Ponder indexer (SI-R1…R5) and reconciliation job.
2. API (SI-R10…R14), OpenAPI spec, typed SDK client.
3. `ShortInterestLens` (SI-R20…R21).
4. Web app screens ([06](06-web-app.md)) in order: Markets → Lend → Short → Portfolio → Short-interest dashboard → Alerts.
5. Alerts service (APP-R8).
6. Compliance signer and geo-block (CP-R1…R4).
7. Testnet deployment, faucet for mock stocks and USDG, tester program.

## Definition of done (any requirement)

- Code merged with tests. Contracts need ≥ 95% line coverage and fuzz/invariant tests where specified.
- The requirement ID is referenced in the test name or PR.
- SDK updated if the math or addresses changed.
- Docs/runbook updated if behavior visible to operators changed.
